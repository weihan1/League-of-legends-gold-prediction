League of Legends Gold Prediction is a school project in which I had to perform various data analysis techniques (EDA, hypothesis tests, power transformation, Outlier detection, model selection, etc.) to come up with the best model that explained the amount of Gold (in-game currency) a player generated using a linear regression model. The dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/braydenrogowski/league-of-legends-worlds-2021-playin-group-stats. 

Research project 2 is the code, and final research 3 is the research paper.
